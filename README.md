# httpGod

An useless HTTP-server written for the educational purposes (_learning **Go**_).

If you want to play with it, then you need a fully configured [Go environment](https://golang.org/doc/install).

**Usage**:

* `make` — build.
* `make install` — install **httpGod** binary into your **$GOPATH**.
* `make uninstall`
* `make clean`
* `make run` — equal to `go run *`.
* `make serve` — serve your **$HOME** folder under the port **8080**.
* `make fun` — compare a fun implementation with the proper one.
